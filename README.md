====================

While browsing Amazon find other sellers of the same book using this bookmarklet

The Hachette-Amazon feud makes it hard to buy some books from Amazon. Or you may want to not buy any books at Amazon for a while. This bookmarklet helps.

This lets you browse Amazon for books, click on the bookmarklet and then see other sellers of the same book. This is done using directtextbook.com with whom I have no connection. If you have suggestions for other portals, I'm open.

How to use this:

1. Drag and drop this link to your Bookmark Toolbar: <a href='javascript:(function(){var n=0;while(document.getElementsByTagName("link")[n].getAttribute("rel")!="canonical"){n++};window.open("http://www.directtextbook.com/isbn/"+document.getElementsByTagName("link")[n].getAttribute("href").slice(-10))})();'>ByPassAmazonHackette
2. Visit <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-And-Chamber-Secrets/dp/0439064872'>Amazon.com</a>
3. Click on the ByPassAmazonHachette bookmarklet in your toolbar to see other options for buying the book.
